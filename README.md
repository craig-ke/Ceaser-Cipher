# Ceaser Cypher.
# Craig Lawrence Olonyi.
# Description
In this application you can be able to implement ceaser cypher code.
The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):

Plain:     THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Cipher:    QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

Open with IntelliJ or any other compatible Java program.

## User Stories
1. The shift key must be between 1 and 25.
2. Only alphabetic letters are shifted. Numbers and other characters are returned unshifted.
3. During encryption, letters are shifted forward by the given shift key.
4. During decryption, letters are shifted backward by the given shift key.
